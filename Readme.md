# How I write Go

This repository contains code snippets and best practices I've accumulated over my 10 years of writing Go. I'm documenting the patterns and techniques I've learned, both for reference and as a learning tool. If this repo is interesting, you may be interested in my [blog](https://blog.nikajon.es).

## Purpose

- Personal reference for Go patterns and practices
- Documentation of my learning progression
- Showcase of my coding style evolution
- Share what I've learned with the Go community

## Code Structure

### Project Organization

I follow the standard Go project layout:

```
project/
├── cmd/           # Main applications
├── internal/      # Private code
├── pkg/           # Public libraries
├── api/           # API definitions
└── web/           # Web assets
```
